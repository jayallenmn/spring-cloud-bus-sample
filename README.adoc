Spring Cloud Bus Demo
---------------------

This is a simple demonstration of Spring Cloud Bus feature of being able to refresh properties in all instances of an application

.Start up RabbitMQ Server
[source,java]
----
rabbitmq-server
----

.Start up Config Server
[source,java]
----
cd sample-config
mvn spring-boot:run
----

.Start up Service instance 1
[source,java]
----
cd sample-service
mvn spring-boot:run
----

.Start up Service instance 2
[source,java]
----
cd sample-service
mvn spring-boot:run -Dserver.port=8081
----

If all the applications have come up cleanly, the endpoint should be available at http://localhost:8080/show, http://localhost:8081/show

To change a property, modify the configuration(s) pointed to in the git repo defined in sample-config application.yml.

The change will not reflect in the the applications until you publish the webhook event for the config server.

If you do not have public ip address or public domain name set up yet, you can publish (simulate) the webhook event for the Config Server by calling the /monitor endpoint with given request body. Then the Config Server will consider it as a webhook event published by the related repository service provider and continue with rest of the operations.

[source]
----
curl -v -X POST "http://localhost:8080/monitor" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-Event-Key: repo:push" \
-H "X-Hook-UUID: webhook-uuid" \
-d '{"push": {"changes": []} }'
----
. The changed property should now reflect on all instances of the application.
